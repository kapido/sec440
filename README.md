# Ransomware Reflection
This project overall was super ineteresting. It fit perfectly in my week as I had enough time to research mitigation techniques and decide on applocker. It suited what we wanted to do and disallowed any ransomware from running on our system. The implementation was a little janky only because the policies were not pushing the way I was expecting them to but I eventually got it to work.
